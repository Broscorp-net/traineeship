/**
 * ! REMOVE ME !
 *
 * <p>Solution:
 * 1. Don NOT extract anything.
 * 2. Class renaming is possible. But then additional comment is required about the rename decision.
 *
 * <p>Explanation:
 * The name of interface just distracts from the main responsibility.
 * The most of methods are for storage and only one looks like about formatting.
 * And that only method is too few for extracting it into separated class.
 * So some attention have to be paid for the mixed responsibility.
 * And if name is changed regarding the responsibility then this have to be provided
 * to reviewer via javadoc or any other method.
