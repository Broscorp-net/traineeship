## JVM
Java Virtual Machine acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications.
It converts Java bytecode into machines language.
## JRE
The JRE combines Java code created using the JDK with the necessary libraries required to run it on a JVM and then creates an instance of the JVM that executes the resulting program.
## JIT
JIT compiler interacts
with the JVM at runtime and compiles appropriate bytecode sequences into native machine code. When using a JIT compiler, the hardware can execute the native code, as opposed to having the JVM interpret the same sequence of bytecode repeatedly.
## JDK
The JDK is a development environment for building applications, applets, and components using the Java programming language.
